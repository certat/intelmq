Malware Name Mapping
====================

This script fetches the current mapping file from the [Malware Name Mapping repository](https://github.com/certtools/malware_name_mapping/raw/master/mapping.txt) and converts it to the syntax needed by the modify expert.
It expects a tab-separated file and uses the first column as regular expression and the second one as family name. Other URLs can be given as parameter.
The resulting configuration sets the field `classification.identifier` to the malware family name corresponding to the given `malware.name`.

By default, the result is printed to stdout, a filename can be given as parameter.

For more information about the mapping project, have a look at the [Malware Name Mapping repository](https://github.com/certtools/malware_name_mapping).
